# airbnb-clone-project
Project Overview
    Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

    Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations


    Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


    Technology Stack
Django — High-level Python web framework providing the core app structure, ORM models, admin, and configuration.

Django REST Framework (DRF) — Toolkit for building RESTful APIs with serializers, viewsets, authentication, and browsable docs.

PostgreSQL — Primary relational database storing application data with strong constraints, transactions, and indexing.

GraphQL — Flexible query layer (via Graphene) enabling clients to fetch exactly the data they need and perform mutations.

Celery — Asynchronous task queue for background jobs (emails/notifications, payment webhooks, heavy processing).

Redis — In-memory data store used as Celery broker/result backend and for caching/throttling.

Docker — Containerization for consistent local and production environments; Compose orchestrates app, DB, and Redis.

CI/CD Pipelines — Automated build/test/scan and deploy (e.g., with GitHub Actions) to reliably ship changes to staging/production.


    Database Design
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.

Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance

This section outlines the core data model for the Airbnb Clone backend. It focuses on the key entities and the relationships between them.

Users

Purpose: Represents both guests and hosts (a single user can be both).
Important fields

id — Primary key.

username — Unique login handle.

email — Unique email address.

is_host — Boolean flag indicating if the user can list properties.

created_at — Timestamp for auditing.

Relationships

One User (host) ➜ many Properties.

One User (guest) ➜ many Bookings and many Reviews.

Properties

Purpose: A place that can be booked (hosted by a user).
Important fields

id — Primary key.

host_id — FK → Users.id (the owner/host).

title — Short name of the property.

city, country — Location metadata (extendable to address/lat/lng).

price_per_night, max_guests — Pricing & capacity controls.

Relationships

Bookings

Purpose: A reservation made by a guest for a property.
Important fields

id — Primary key.

property_id — FK → Properties.id.

guest_id — FK → Users.id.

check_in, check_out — Stay window (or a date range).

guests — Number of guests.

total_price — Computed at booking time (nights, fees, discounts).

status — e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed.

Relationships

Many Bookings ➜ one Property.

Many Bookings ➜ one User (guest).

One Booking ➜ one Payment (1:1).

Business/constraints

No overlapping bookings per property for active statuses.

check_out strictly after check_in.

guests ≤ Properties.max_guests.

Payments

Purpose: Tracks payment lifecycle for a booking.
Important fields

id — Primary key.

booking_id — Unique FK → Bookings.id (enforces 1:1).

amount, currency — Monetary details.

provider — e.g., stripe, mpesa.

provider_payment_id — External reference.

status — e.g., requires_action, pending, succeeded, failed, refunded.

created_at — Timestamp for auditing.

Relationships

One Payment ⇄ one Booking (1:1).

Notes

Status is updated via provider webhooks/callbacks.

Refunds are represented as status changes with provider references.

Reviews

Purpose: Guest feedback on properties.
Important fields

id — Primary key.

property_id — FK → Properties.id.

guest_id — FK → Users.id.

rating — Integer 1–5.

comment — Optional text.

created_at — Timestamp.

Relationships

Many Reviews ➜ one Property.

Many Reviews ➜ one User (guest).

Constraints

One review per (guest_id, property_id) pair (prevents duplicates).

rating must be between 1 and 5.

Cardinality Summary

User (host) 1 ➜ N Properties

Property 1 ➜ N Bookings

User (guest) 1 ➜ N Bookings

Booking 1 ⇄ 1 Payment

Property 1 ➜ N Reviews

User (guest) 1 ➜ N Reviews

Deletion behavior (recommended):

Deleting a Property should cascade to its Bookings and Reviews.

Deleting a Booking should cascade to its Payment.

Deleting a User should be restricted if they own Properties or reassign those first; guest-owned Bookings/Reviews can cascade or be soft-deleted depending on policy.

    Feature Breakdown
User Management
Secure registration, login, and JWT-based authentication for both guests and hosts. Users can manage profiles (e.g., host flag), while role-aware permissions protect host-only actions like creating or editing properties.

Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and deactivate property listings with key details (location, pricing, capacity, amenities, images). Search, filtering, and ordering enable fast discovery, while validation ensures data quality and consistency.

Booking System
Guests can check availability and create reservations with validated date ranges and guest counts. Overlap prevention and booking statuses (pending/confirmed/cancelled/completed) maintain accurate calendars and support downstream workflows.

Payment Processing
Each booking links to a single payment record that tracks amount, currency, provider (e.g., Stripe/M-Pesa), and status. Webhook/callback handling updates payment state reliably, enabling confirmations, failures, and refunds to propagate to the booking.

Review System
Guests can rate and review properties after stays, with a one-review-per-guest-per-property rule and rating validation (1–5). Aggregated ratings help users assess quality and build trust across the platform.

Data Optimization
PostgreSQL indexes and constraints (e.g., range overlap checks) keep queries accurate and fast at scale. Redis caching, pagination, and background tasks (Celery) reduce API latency and offload heavy work (e.g., notifications), improving overall responsiveness.

    API Security
Key Security Measures
Authentication
JWT access/refresh tokens with short access-token lifetimes and refresh rotation; optional MFA and email verification.
Secure password hashing (Argon2/PBKDF2), password reset via signed, expiring tokens only.
Brute-force login protection (login throttling, lockouts after repeated failures).

Authorization
Role- and object-level permissions (hosts manage only their own properties; guests can only see/modify their own bookings/payments).
Admin endpoints separated and optionally IP-allowlisted.
Serializer-level field whitelisting to prevent mass assignment.

Rate Limiting & Throttling
Per-IP and per-user throttles for read/write APIs (DRF throttling, Redis-backed).
Separate, stricter limits for auth endpoints and GraphQL mutations.

Transport & Session Security
Enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere; HSTS enabled in production.
Secure, same-site cookies if cookies are used; no tokens in URLs; CORS restricted to known origins.

Input Validation & Output Encoding
Strong request validation via serializers/schemas; server-side pagination & max page sizes.
Reject oversized payloads/uploads; sanitize filenames; content-type checks for media.

Data Protection
Passwords hashed; sensitive fields never logged or returned.
Database access via least-privilege credentials; backups encrypted; at-rest encryption at the volume/provider level.

Payments & Webhooks
Provider signature verification (e.g., Stripe webhook secret, M-Pesa callback verification).
Idempotency keys for payment operations; reconcile booking state from verified webhook events only.

GraphQL-Specific Controls
Auth required for mutations; query depth/complexity limits and timeouts.
Disable GraphiQL and limit introspection in production; optionally use persisted queries.

Secrets & Supply Chain
Secrets in environment variables/secret manager; never committed; regular rotation.
Dependency scanning (e.g., Safety/Bandit), pinned versions, and CI checks.

Logging, Monitoring & Auditing
Structured logs for auth, bookings, payments, and admin actions (with user/id, request id, IP, UA).
Alerting on anomalous activity; privacy-aware log redaction; audit trails retained per policy.

Operational Hardening
Security headers (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.).
Docker images run as non-root with minimal base, only needed ports exposed.

    Why Security Is Crucial (by Area)

Protecting User Accounts & Data
Prevents account takeover and exposure of PII (emails, names, activity). Trust hinges on confidentiality and integrity of user data.

Securing Properties & Media
Ensures only hosts can modify their listings and uploaded media are safe to store/serve. Stops fraud and malicious file uploads.

Safeguarding Bookings & Availability
Prevents tampering with calendars and reservations (no ghost or double bookings). Integrity here directly impacts user experience and revenue.

Payments & Financial Data
Signature-verified webhooks, idempotency, and strict state transitions prevent fraudulent charges and mismatched booking/payment states. Financial correctness and compliance depend on this.

Reviews & Platform Reputation
Authenticated, one-per-guest reviews with abuse prevention reduce spam and manipulation. Reliable reviews build marketplace trust.

API Reliability & Fair Use
Throttling and input limits protect availability against scraping/DoS while keeping latency predictable for all clients.

Operations & Compliance
Proper logging, alerting, backups, and secret handling enable incident response and legal/contractual compliance without leaking sensitive info.

    CI/CD Pipeline
    What it is:
Continuous Integration (CI) automatically builds, tests, and analyzes the code on every change (PR/commit). Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) packages the app (Docker image), pushes it to a registry, and releases it to a target environment (staging/prod) in a repeatable way.

Why it matters:
CI/CD catches bugs early, enforces quality/security gates, and keeps environments consistent. It speeds up feedback, reduces regressions, and makes deployments low-risk (automated, versioned, and reproducible), which is critical for a platform handling bookings, payments, and user data.

Typical workflow (high level):

CI: Lint, format, type-check, and test → collect coverage and generate API schema docs.

Security gates: Dependency and static security scans.

Build & publish: Build Docker image, tag with commit SHA/semver, push to container registry.

Deploy: Roll out to staging (run migrations, collectstatic, restart web/celery), smoke test; then promote to production (blue/green or rolling).

Post-deploy: Health checks, alerts, and automatic rollback on failure.

Tools to use:

Orchestration: GitHub Actions (workflows for PR checks, builds, deployments).

Containers: Docker & Docker Compose (local parity), Docker Buildx; Registry: GHCR or Docker Hub.

Testing/Quality: pytest, coverage, flake8/ruff, black, mypy (optional).

Security: Bandit (SAST), Safety or pip-audit (dependency vulns), secret scanning.

Database/Cache in CI: Postgres & Redis service containers.

Docs: drf-spectacular to auto-generate OpenAPI; publish as an artifact or to /api/docs.

Deploy targets (pick one): Fly.io, Render, AWS ECS/Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, or Kubernetes.

Secrets: GitHub Actions Secrets/OIDC to cloud provider (no secrets in repo).
