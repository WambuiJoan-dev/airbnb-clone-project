# airbnb-clone-project
Project Overview
    Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

    Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations


    Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


    Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

Redis: Used for caching and session management.

Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

    Database Design
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.

Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance

    Feature Breakdown
User Management
Secure registration, login, and JWT-based authentication for both guests and hosts. Users can manage profiles (e.g., host flag), while role-aware permissions protect host-only actions like creating or editing properties.

Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and deactivate property listings with key details (location, pricing, capacity, amenities, images). Search, filtering, and ordering enable fast discovery, while validation ensures data quality and consistency.

Booking System
Guests can check availability and create reservations with validated date ranges and guest counts. Overlap prevention and booking statuses (pending/confirmed/cancelled/completed) maintain accurate calendars and support downstream workflows.

Payment Processing
Each booking links to a single payment record that tracks amount, currency, provider (e.g., Stripe/M-Pesa), and status. Webhook/callback handling updates payment state reliably, enabling confirmations, failures, and refunds to propagate to the booking.

Review System
Guests can rate and review properties after stays, with a one-review-per-guest-per-property rule and rating validation (1â€“5). Aggregated ratings help users assess quality and build trust across the platform.

Data Optimization
PostgreSQL indexes and constraints (e.g., range overlap checks) keep queries accurate and fast at scale. Redis caching, pagination, and background tasks (Celery) reduce API latency and offload heavy work (e.g., notifications), improving overall responsiveness.
