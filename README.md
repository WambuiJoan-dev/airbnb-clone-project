# airbnb-clone-project
Project Overview
    Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

    Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations


    Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


    Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

Redis: Used for caching and session management.

Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

    Database Design
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.

Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance

    Feature Breakdown
User Management
Secure registration, login, and JWT-based authentication for both guests and hosts. Users can manage profiles (e.g., host flag), while role-aware permissions protect host-only actions like creating or editing properties.

Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and deactivate property listings with key details (location, pricing, capacity, amenities, images). Search, filtering, and ordering enable fast discovery, while validation ensures data quality and consistency.

Booking System
Guests can check availability and create reservations with validated date ranges and guest counts. Overlap prevention and booking statuses (pending/confirmed/cancelled/completed) maintain accurate calendars and support downstream workflows.

Payment Processing
Each booking links to a single payment record that tracks amount, currency, provider (e.g., Stripe/M-Pesa), and status. Webhook/callback handling updates payment state reliably, enabling confirmations, failures, and refunds to propagate to the booking.

Review System
Guests can rate and review properties after stays, with a one-review-per-guest-per-property rule and rating validation (1â€“5). Aggregated ratings help users assess quality and build trust across the platform.

Data Optimization
PostgreSQL indexes and constraints (e.g., range overlap checks) keep queries accurate and fast at scale. Redis caching, pagination, and background tasks (Celery) reduce API latency and offload heavy work (e.g., notifications), improving overall responsiveness.

    API Security
Key Security Measures
Authentication
JWT access/refresh tokens with short access-token lifetimes and refresh rotation; optional MFA and email verification.
Secure password hashing (Argon2/PBKDF2), password reset via signed, expiring tokens only.
Brute-force login protection (login throttling, lockouts after repeated failures).

Authorization
Role- and object-level permissions (hosts manage only their own properties; guests can only see/modify their own bookings/payments).
Admin endpoints separated and optionally IP-allowlisted.
Serializer-level field whitelisting to prevent mass assignment.

Rate Limiting & Throttling
Per-IP and per-user throttles for read/write APIs (DRF throttling, Redis-backed).
Separate, stricter limits for auth endpoints and GraphQL mutations.

Transport & Session Security
Enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere; HSTS enabled in production.
Secure, same-site cookies if cookies are used; no tokens in URLs; CORS restricted to known origins.

Input Validation & Output Encoding
Strong request validation via serializers/schemas; server-side pagination & max page sizes.
Reject oversized payloads/uploads; sanitize filenames; content-type checks for media.

Data Protection
Passwords hashed; sensitive fields never logged or returned.
Database access via least-privilege credentials; backups encrypted; at-rest encryption at the volume/provider level.

Payments & Webhooks
Provider signature verification (e.g., Stripe webhook secret, M-Pesa callback verification).
Idempotency keys for payment operations; reconcile booking state from verified webhook events only.

GraphQL-Specific Controls
Auth required for mutations; query depth/complexity limits and timeouts.
Disable GraphiQL and limit introspection in production; optionally use persisted queries.

Secrets & Supply Chain
Secrets in environment variables/secret manager; never committed; regular rotation.
Dependency scanning (e.g., Safety/Bandit), pinned versions, and CI checks.

Logging, Monitoring & Auditing
Structured logs for auth, bookings, payments, and admin actions (with user/id, request id, IP, UA).
Alerting on anomalous activity; privacy-aware log redaction; audit trails retained per policy.

Operational Hardening
Security headers (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.).
Docker images run as non-root with minimal base, only needed ports exposed.

    Why Security Is Crucial (by Area)

Protecting User Accounts & Data

Prevents account takeover and exposure of PII (emails, names, activity). Trust hinges on confidentiality and integrity of user data.

Securing Properties & Media

Ensures only hosts can modify their listings and uploaded media are safe to store/serve. Stops fraud and malicious file uploads.

Safeguarding Bookings & Availability

Prevents tampering with calendars and reservations (no ghost or double bookings). Integrity here directly impacts user experience and revenue.

Payments & Financial Data

Signature-verified webhooks, idempotency, and strict state transitions prevent fraudulent charges and mismatched booking/payment states. Financial correctness and compliance depend on this.

Reviews & Platform Reputation

Authenticated, one-per-guest reviews with abuse prevention reduce spam and manipulation. Reliable reviews build marketplace trust.

API Reliability & Fair Use

Throttling and input limits protect availability against scraping/DoS while keeping latency predictable for all clients.

Operations & Compliance

Proper logging, alerting, backups, and secret handling enable incident response and legal/contractual compliance without leaking sensitive info.
